The kessler microphysical scheme from WRF model written in Fortran95 is called from Python using the ccfi library. 

First, you have to get the kessler module from WRF model.
The code is available for free at:
http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources.html

Once you have downloaded it, unpack it to /usr/local/src or alike.
The location of WRF source tree can be communicated to CMake with
the WRF_SRC_PATH environment variable, e.g. (using bash):

$ WRF_SRC_PATH=/tmp/WRFV3 cmake ..

Now you can call python code - kessler_call.py, that calls python-kessler function defined in cffi_kessler.py using a foreign function interface (tested with python 2.7 and cffi 0.8.2):
> python kessler_call.py

The kessler_call.py is just a simple example of calling kessler for a one grid point.

*Single precision:
If you want to compile with singe precision, you should skip the -fdefault-real-8 option, change double to float in the C-binding part (kessler_wrap.f90 and cffi_kessler.py), and ask explicitly numpy to creat float32 array (kessler_call.py). Please see the versions before June 25th, 2014.
